Converts an arbitrary input to a native [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set). Similar to `new Set`. Differences:

  * If input is already a set: **return as-is without copying**.
  * Otherwise, create a set of the input's [#`values`](#function-values).
    * [#Maps](#function-ismap) and [#structs](#function-isstruct) are treated as collections of their values rather than key-value entries.
