Signature: `(src: Iter<A>, acc: B, fun: (B, A) => B) => B`.

Similar to [`Array.prototype.reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce). Differences:

  * Takes an arbitrary iterable compatible with [#`values`](#function-values).
  * Iterable may be [#nil](#function-isnil), equivalent to `[]`.
  * Arguments are `(src, acc, fun)` rather than `(fun, acc)`.
  * Accumulator argument is mandatory.
  * Doesn't support `this`.
  * Iterator function receives exactly two arguments: accumulator and next value.
