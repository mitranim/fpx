Signature: `(Iter<A>, A => Key | any) => {[Key: A[]]}`.

Takes an arbitrary iterable compatible with [#`values`](#function-values) and groups its values by keys generated by the given function. The function is called for each value. If the function returns a [#valid key](#function-iskey), the value is added to the index under that key. Invalid keys are ignored.

Compare [#`index`](#function-index), which keeps only the last value for each group.
