Alias for [`Array.isArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray). Used internally for all array checks.

True if value is an instance of [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) or its subclass. False for all other values, including non-array objects whose prototype is an array.
