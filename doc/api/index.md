Signature: `(Iter<A>, A => Key | any) => {[Key: A]}`.

Takes an arbitrary iterable compatible with [#`values`](#function-values) and returns an index where its values are _keyed_ by the given function, hence the name. The function is called for each value. If the function returns a [#valid key](#function-iskey), the key-value pair is added to the index. Invalid keys are ignored. If the function returns the same key for multiple values, previous values are lost.

Similar to Lodash's `_.keyBy`. Compare [#`group`](#function-group) which keeps all values for each group, rather than only the last.
