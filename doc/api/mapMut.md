Similar to [`Array.prototype.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map). Differences:

  * Mutates the input (which must be an array).
  * Doesn't support `this` or additional arguments.

For a non-mutating version, see [#`map`](#function-map).
